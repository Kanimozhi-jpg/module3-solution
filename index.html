      <h2>Chicken</h2><p>The brooder is what your chicks will live in for at least the first 4-5 weeks of their life. Whether you are picking chicks up from the local feed store, are mail ordering your chicks, or have chicks hatching from incubated eggs, the first priority before getting your chicks should be having the brooder all properly set up. The brooder should be a safe haven for your chicks that is predator proof and has a food source, water source, heat source, and soft, cushy litter.  

You’ll want to place their food and water close to the heat source when you acquaint the chicks with their new home. After that, the brooder should have a section with the supplemental heat source and a section with the food and water. For supplemental heat, you have two options: a heat lamp or a radiant heater. While either one will work, radiant heaters are the safest, healthiest, and most natural option for brooding baby chicks.  </p><br>

<section id="section2">
<h2>Beef</h2><p>If you’ve ever listened or watched one of the news reports about antibiotics used in meat production or yet another food recall, you’ve probably cringed and thought, “There is something seriously wrong with our food system!” When substances used to grow our food cause potential harm to the livestock and to ourselves, there certainly appears to be a problem. If you’re anything like me, you want to be able to feed your family wholesome food that is raised according to your ethical and health standards.

I grew up on grassfed beef long before it became the cool thing on the market. My father, having grown up during the Great Depression, knew the reality of not having food to eat if you didn’t raise it yourself. My parents raised our own beef because it was cheaper than purchasing it in the store. At that time, grain-fed beef was preferred, but where I live in the Pacific Northwest, we didn’t have acres of pasture to grow our own grain, and grain was more expensive than grass hay.</p><br>

<h2>Sushi</h2><p>A dish known as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time, has been cited as one of the early influences for the Japanese practice of applying rice on raw fish.[3] The fish was fermented with rice vinegar, salt, and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The process can be traced back to the early domestication of rice in the neolithic cultures of China, fermentation methods following similar logic in other asian rice cultures include: Pla ra (ปลาร้า), Burong isda, Sikhae (식해), Amazake (甘酒) .[3][4] The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevents the fish from spoiling. When wet-field rice cultivation was introduced during the Yayoi period, lakes and rivers would flood during the rainy season and fish would get caught in the rice paddy fields. Pickling was a way to preserve the excess fish and guarantee food for the next months, and Narezushi became an important source of protein for Japanese consumers. The term sushi literally means "sour-tasting" and comes from an antiquated し (shi) terminal-form conjugation, 酸し sushi, no longer used in other contexts, of the adjectival verb 酸い sui "to be sour";[5] the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[6] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.[7]


Osaka-style sushi, also called "Oshi-zushi" or "hako-sushi"
Vinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the sourness of the rice, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be further developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became oshi-zushi or "hako-zushi"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.

It was not until the Edo period (1603–1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice and nori. The particular style of today's nigirizushi became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of nigirizushi's origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799–1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku.[7] The dish was originally termed Edomae zushi as it used freshly caught fish from the Edo-mae (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term Edomae nigirizushi is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.[8][9]</p><!-- .co
